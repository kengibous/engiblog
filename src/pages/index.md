    I am a 35-year-old male living in Mesa, Arizona, as of April 2021 (from Waukesha, WI) - with a passion for all things computer-related. I have been amazed with computers and technology since I was a little kid, and nothing about that has changed. Currently I am a System Architect - focusing on Kubernetes based solutions and helping teams adopt DevSecOps practices
