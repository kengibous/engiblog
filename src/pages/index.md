    I am a 35-year-old male from Waukesha, Wisconsin, with a passion for all things computer-related. I have been amazed with computers and technology since I was a little kid, and nothing about that has changed. By day, I am a server architect, spending most of my time administrating Windows servers. By night, I am a developer who dabbles in a variety of programming languages and technologies. Most of my time has ben spent doing .NET development. Currently, I have been working on Single Page Web Applications (SPAs), using Bootstrap, Angular JS, and ASP MVC WebAPI. I am also currently reading up on nodeJS and looking forward to potentially using it in future projects.
